# Contenders

This is a general guide for contender applications that describes how to  
participate in Questionator's extreme startup.

## Get started

It's easy, buddy! Just follow following steps:

1. Run the app with ``` npm run start```

2. Get your tunnel-url (```https://node-js-contender.localtunnel.me``` by default, could be changed in ```contender.json```)
 and register it in Questinator's extreme-startup.
 
3. Start getting questions and handle them in ```answer.js```. 
By default, question is expected to be a url query string  ```question``` parameter. Otherwise, you should adjust your ```contender.js```.    

That's all! Feel the start-up flavour and have fun.


## Note
 To check you local server works properly, open in browser: Local_tunnel_link?question=testQuestion, f.e. https://node-js-contender.localtunnel.me?question=testQuestion
