# Contenders

This is a general guide for contender applications that describes how to  
participate in Questionator's extreme startup.

## Get started

It's easy, buddy! Just follow following steps:
1. Run the app with ``` npm install```
2. Run the app with ``` npm run questinator-connector```
3. Specify game session url, your email and you local server port (7000 by default)

3. Run your local server with ``` npm run start```
 
4. Start getting questions and handle them in ```answer.js```.
 
By default, question is expected to be a url query string  ```question``` parameter. Otherwise, you should adjust your ```contender.js```.    

That's all! Feel the start-up flavour and have fun.
